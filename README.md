# etchersketcher
Etcher sketcher made in python that uses controller inputs to draw!

## How??
Uses controller joystick to draw in the window. Button 1 (usually a button) takes a screenshot of your masterpiece. Button 2 (usually b) will remove some of the pixels to simulate the shaking of an etcher sketcher. Get rid of it!!

## Screenshot example
![Alt text](/testscreenshot.jpg?raw=true "My masterpiece")

## Future
I might make it so that holding button 2 and moving the stick shakes the pixels rather than just pressing the button but idk ok thanks byee
